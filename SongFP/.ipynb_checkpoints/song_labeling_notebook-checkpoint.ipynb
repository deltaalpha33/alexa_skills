    " ## Jasper vs. Alexa\n",
    " \n",
    " As great as Jasper is for development, Alexa (as you would expect) has a leg up. First, Alexa uses its own STT and TTS processing that, as you've probably noticed in working with Jasper, filters out a lot of the noise in the microphone input to accurately detect voice commands. Furthermore, Alexa has a lot more skills than we have currently implemented on Jasper. However, we have also established the framework for constructing many of the skills that Alexa has. For example, suppose that rather than simply writing to and from a website that we developed ourselves, we connected a Jasper skill to our Netflix account. Then, we could queue up episodes and movies just as Alexa does. Or, if we had more Arduino boards or Raspberry Pi's, we could potentially connect other devices such as coffee machines, lights, and other things. \n",

    "\n",
    "### [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Qu'est-ce que c'est? AWS, as y'all probably know, is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides \"reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.\" Under AWS, there are several services that are very useful and that many people use on scales from personal to enterprise. One of these services is AWS Lambda, which is an interesting business model in which you can run code without provisioning or managing servers so that you only pay for the compute time you consume, which is revolutionary because such a seamless service allows for the most efficient use of servers, which as you may know are costly and consume lots of space and power. \n",
    "\n",
    "### [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course if you don't know what Alexa is, I would be slightly concerned. But, did you know that you can also program skills for Alexa just as you have been programming skills for Jasper? Surprise! You can. In fact we will be programming skills for Alexa so more on this later. Also, out of personal curiosity, what do you think is a good name for a cognitive assistant? Let Melanie know. \n",
    "\n",
    "### [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service)\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon actually has two entire buildings in the Kendall Square area at the moment working on Alexa, so you'll notice that Alexa's speech to text software is more impeccable than almost any other softwares out there. It is able to filter noise from long distances and has been doing so for many years, even though the \"Internet of Things\" (IOT) truly only became a trend a while ago. So, beyond using Jasper, you can also build products using Alexa Voice Services which essentially provides the STT and TTS capabilities that Jasper provides but not open source and with better performance. This voice services is one of the functionalities that makes Alexa stand out on the market as IOT capabilities are not yet that developed, although if you are interested in IOT projects, many companies are working on the concept of smart homes for various purposes, or simply \"smart buildings.\" If you just rattle off a list of some of the biggest names in the tech industry (Microsoft, IBM, etc.) these companies have all been proposing smart homes for decades, but the advancement of bluetooth technology, machine learning, and essentially the efficiency and costs of the hardware required to complement the software that have come about in recent years has finally enabled companies to make these visions reality. This is an exciting time (not to even mention quantum computing and all the changes that could bring) so keep your eye out for really cool developments in the coming years! \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Actual Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will build our own Alexa Skill which we will implement using Flask Ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few prerequisites that we will need for this module: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Install flask-ask! You can do this through `pip install flask-ask` if it is not already installed\n",
    "* Create an amazon account! If you already have one proceed to the next step, otherwise,  probably create one \n",
    "* Go to https://www.developer.amazon.com and register as an Amazon developer using your new Amazon account. \n",
    "* Now you have all the accounts you need. To prepare your Alexa device, first plug in the cord that comes with it in the box, then go to https://alexa.amazon.com. Sign in with your Amazon.com account and then follow the instructions that come in the box with your Echo Dot to get it connected to Wi-Fi. Networks at MIT tend to vary in signal strength based on where you are around campus, but the MIT GUEST network is usually a solid bet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have everything set up, let's start!\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously mentioned that we would be using Flask Ask, a Flask extension that enables simple Alexa skill creation in only one Python file, sort of similar to the skills that we developed for Jasper. Recall that the simplest piece of code for Flask looks something along these lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__=='__main__':\n",
    "   app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "An Alexa skill is also an app, but rather than loading some response when we navigate to a page by clicking some button as we do with web applications, verbal communications serve as the equivalent of navigation within the app. For our code, we will be using [decorators](https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-python-decorators/) such as @ask.launch or @ask.intent(\"someIntent\"). For our sample app, let's say that we want Alexa to tell us the latest news. First, we define our \"homepage.\" \n",

    "    welcome_message = 'Hello there, would you like the news?'\n",
    "    return question(welcome_message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above code essentially prompts users with this question whenever the app is launched. Then, you'll notice that we have phrased our prompt as a yes or no question, which means that the user response or \"intent\" will either be a yes or a no. So, we can term these \"YesIntent\" and \"NoIntent\". \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@ask.intent(\"YesIntent\")\n",
    "def share_headlines():\n",

    "    bye_text = 'Okay, goodbye'\n",
    "    return statement(bye_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, if the user responds affirmatively to the prompt, then it is defined as a YesIntent (which we will elaborate on later), and similarly a negative response would be a NoIntent. Then, to actually define the get_headlines() function that will scrape data from online, we can choose the website. We will be retrieving headlines from the world's most reputable news source, Reddit. \n",
    "\n",

    "def get_headlines():\n",

    "### Side Note about Multiple Skills \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run multiple skills at the same time on your Alexa, you have two options. You can either run multiple flask servers and ngrok servers on different ports of your localhost, or you can put all the Python code in the same file and just make sure to be careful about how you define the intents, so that if two skills have the same intents, you could for example have a global variable outside of the functions and check the global variable to determine what functionality to run when that intent is called. Then, in order to run multiple flask and ngrok servers at the same time, you will need to use a different port for each pair of servers. For ngrok, it's pretty simple. If you want to run on a different port, you just type into the command line which port you want to run on. So, if you choose port 5001, then you can just run in terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./ngrok http 5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Flask servers, it's also pretty simple in the command line. The default port for the localhost is port 5000, but if you want to run on say port 5001 to match our ngrok server, you can run in your terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=skill.py\n",
    "flask run -h localhost -p 5001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equivalent of running our flask server by running our python program, and now you will be able to run multiple skills on different servers simultaneously!\n",
